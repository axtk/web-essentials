_Customizable CSS styles for plain HTML components_

## Features

- the styles are **applied to plain HTML elements**, no need for wrapper markup or additional class names;
- the styles are **quickly customizable via CSS variables**: custom themes (single or multiple within an app) can be introduced by redefining values of relevant CSS variables listed in [`components/index.css`](components/index.css);
- the styles maintain **visual scalability out of the box**: no need for size presets, the components scale consistently with the surrounding content out of the box by having their dimensions defined in `em` units.
